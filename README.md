# HearingTheShapeOfADrum

This repository contains the files used to answer the MathOverflow question [Can one hear the shape of a drum by choosing where to drum it?](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/227707/can-one-hear-the-shape-of-a-drum-by-choosing-where-to-drum-it), specifically by proving that there exist pairs of isospectral surfaces (and, in fact, this holds for some canonical examples of ) that are nevertheless 'acoustically distinguishable' in the sense of the question: while their spectra match, the actual timbre produced when drumming them depends on where you hit the drum, and the relative strengths of the different eigenfunctions there, and each drum has points whose timbre is not accessible to the other drum.

The code is a *Mathematica* notebook, with a corresponding pdf printout for convenience.
